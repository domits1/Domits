                    Domits is starting out simple with making conscious decisions like
                    choosing more energy-saving appliances and will continue to improve
                    this 1% every day. With our food waste policy we don’t want to be to
                    rigid and starting with a flexible recycling plan for glass, paper,
                    plastic and organic. For biodiversity and ecosystems we’re aiming to
                    eat more organic food, use Eco-friendly cleaning products and have
                    paperless procedures.

                    Domits is actively focusing on onboarding hosts that are already
                    sustainable. If they’re not yet, we’re supporting them step-by-step to
                    increase awareness. At a certain point we want to give hosts
                    certifications as a proof of sustainability with energy, waste,
                    biodiversity, ecosystems, destinations and community.

                    with having sustainability filters and a large overview of all
                    eco-friendly amenities.
