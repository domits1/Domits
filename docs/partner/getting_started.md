# Welcome to the Domits Partner Folder!
This folder is the main place for all information about Domits and our partners. It helps you understand how to connect your system with the Domits platform and manage things like listings, availability, and reservations.

Here you can find guides, examples, and updates that explain how everything works. You’ll also find information about security, testing, and how to get certified as a partner. Everything is kept in one place so it’s easy to find what you need.

This folder is made to help our partners work smoothly with Domits. Whether you’re starting a new connection or already working with us, you can use this folder to get the tools and help you need.
