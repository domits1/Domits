NL: Met programmeren is het belangrijk om goed na te denken. Hierbij een opzet voor het delen en structureren van issues.

EN: If you are stuck (and you will be, many times..) and want to talk to another developer, here is a guide. 

#### We like to maintain the harmony, unity and peace.

- First, the average time to debug can take up to sometimes more than 40 hours. It could be that you have not made progress, that is annoying and possibly worse, more upsetting than you would like to admit, and that is all fine.

- Second, make the issue you have reproducible. Please share your understanding of what you expected, and the actual situation, what you think the problem is, the ways you approach the problem, or solutions that you've tried. Best way is to create a branch, so that the other developer can pull and recreate what you see within 1-5 minutes. 

To summarise, before sharing a problem/bug/issue, please provide the following (this can be in Dutch or English):

# The structure:

## Expected situation:
I expected ….

## Actual situation:
What seems to happen is …

## Steps to reproduce:
- pull branch
- check these files
- check these lines of code

## What I researched so far:

Please advise.
