# Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a structured, repeatable process for managing cybersecurity and privacy risk across information systems. Defined in NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, it’s widely used in U.S. government and industry (and underpins FedRAMP for cloud).

## What it does
RMF turns risk management into a lifecycle with clear steps, roles, and evidence:

- Prepare – establish context, roles, risk appetite, supply-chain considerations, and enterprise artifacts.

- Categorize – rate system impact (low/moderate/high) using FIPS 199, define information types and privacy risk.

- Select – choose and tailor controls from NIST SP 800-53 (incl. privacy controls), apply overlays/compensation.

- Implement – put controls in place and document how they work.

- Assess – test control effectiveness using SP 800-53A; record findings and POA&Ms (remediation plans).

- Authorize – a senior Authorizing Official (AO) grants an ATO (Authority to Operate) based on risk.

- Monitor (continuous) – track changes, scan, log, reassess, and update the authorization as risks evolve.

## How it protects
- Risk-based baseline: Impact-driven control selection avoids over/under-securing systems.

- Defense-in-depth controls: Technical, administrative, and privacy safeguards mapped to real risks.

- Accountability: Named roles (AO, ISO, SCA) and auditable artifacts drive sound decisions.

- Continuous monitoring: Early detection of drift and new threats; rapid remediation via POA&Ms.

- Integration: Aligns with supply-chain risk (SP 800-161), SDLC/DevSecOps, and other frameworks (e.g., CSF, ISO 27001).

RMF operationalizes cybersecurity and privacy risk into a measurable, ongoing program—from selecting the right controls to continuously verifying they work—so organizations can make informed, defensible decisions about system risk and authorization.
