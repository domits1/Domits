# International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global, independent body that develops voluntary, consensus-based standards to make products, services, and processes safer, more reliable, and interoperable across countries and industries.

## What it does
- Publishes standards across sectors (e.g., ISO 9001 quality, ISO/IEC 27001 information security, ISO 14001 environment, ISO 45001 OH&S).

- Facilitates consensus among industry, government, and academia via national members.

- Updates and harmonizes standards to reflect technology and regulatory change.

- Enables certification by third-party bodies (ISO itself does not certify).

## How it protects
- People & safety: Reduces accidents and health risks (e.g., ISO 45001).

- Information & privacy: Safeguards data through systematic controls (ISO/IEC 27001/27701).

- Quality & reliability: Minimizes defects and variability (ISO 9001).

- Environment & resilience: Lowers environmental impact and improves continuity (ISO 14001, ISO 22301).

- Supply-chain assurance: Common requirements improve interoperability and vendor due diligence.

ISO turns best practices into shared, testable standards. Adopting ISO frameworks helps organizations protect people, data, and the environmentâ€”while boosting trust, efficiency, and global market access.
