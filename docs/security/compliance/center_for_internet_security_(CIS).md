# Center for Internet Security (CIS)
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a nonprofit that develops practical, consensus-based cybersecurity best practices used globally by governments, enterprises, and SMBs.

## What it does
- CIS Controls: A prioritized set of safeguards (v8) that help organizations reduce the most common cyber risks, with Implementation Groups (IG1â€“IG3) for different maturity levels.

- CIS Benchmarks: Secure configuration baselines for operating systems, cloud services, containers, databases, and network devices.

- CIS Hardened Images: Pre-hardened virtual machine images for major clouds that align with CIS Benchmarks.

- CIS-CAT & WorkBench: Tools to assess compliance with Benchmarks and track remediation.

- MS-ISAC/ EI-ISAC: Information-sharing communities for U.S. state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) governments and election entities.

## How it protects
- Prioritized defenses: Focuses effort on controls with the highest risk reduction (asset inventory, vulnerability management, secure configurations, access control, logging/monitoring).

- Secure-by-default configs: Benchmarks harden systems to minimize attack surface and stop common misconfigurations.

- Continuous assurance: CIS-CAT scans detect drift and guide remediation; Hardened Images keep cloud workloads consistently secure.

- Alignment & mapping: Controls map to frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001), easing audits and compliance.

CIS turns cybersecurity best practice into actionable, testable baselines. Adopting CIS Controls and Benchmarks helps organizations quickly shrink attack surface, sustain good hygiene, and demonstrate due diligence.
