# Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary, risk-based framework used worldwide to manage and improve cybersecurity. Version 2.0 organizes cybersecurity outcomes into clear functions and helps organizations of any size prioritize investments and demonstrate due diligence.

## What it does
- Common language & structure: Defines outcomes across six core Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover (with Categories/Subcategories).

- Profiles: Lets you compare a Current Profile (today’s state) to a Target Profile (desired state) to plan improvements.

- Tiers (maturity): Describe how formally and consistently you manage risk (Partial → Risk-Informed → Repeatable → Adaptive).

- Implementation guidance: Maps to controls/standards (e.g., ISO 27001, SP 800-53), supports sector profiles, and aligns with business objectives.

- Scalable & technology-neutral: Works for startups to enterprises, on-prem to cloud/OT.

## How it protects
- Govern & Identify: Establish leadership, risk appetite, roles, asset and supplier inventories to reduce blind spots.

- Protect: Apply safeguards (access control, training, data security, secure development) to prevent or limit incidents.

- Detect: Continuous monitoring, logging, and anomaly detection to spot events quickly.

- Respond: Playbooks, communications, and containment to minimize impact.

- Recover: Backups, restoration, lessons learned, and improvements to restore operations and resilience.

CSF turns cybersecurity into a measurable, business-aligned program. By defining your profiles and iterating, you focus resources on the highest risks, improve resilience, and demonstrate trustworthy security to customers and regulators.
