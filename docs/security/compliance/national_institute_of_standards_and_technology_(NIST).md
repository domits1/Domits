# National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S. federal agency that develops standards, guidelines, and best practices for technology, cybersecurity, and measurements—used worldwide across government and industry.

## What it does
- Publishes cybersecurity frameworks and guidance (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, Risk Management Framework – SP 800-37).

- Issues control catalogs and requirements (e.g., SP 800-53 for security & privacy controls; SP 800-171 for protecting controlled unclassified information).

- Sets cryptographic standards and validations (e.g., FIPS 140-3 for crypto modules).

- Provides playbooks and references for risk, incident response, and zero trust (e.g., SP 800-30 risk assessments, SP 800-61 incident handling, SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture).

- Offers mappings, profiles, and implementation guides to tailor controls to different sectors.

## How it protects
- Risk-based approach: Identify assets/threats, select controls proportionate to risk, and reassess continuously.

- Comprehensive controls: Technical, administrative, and privacy safeguards that reduce likelihood/impact of attacks.

- Assurance & interoperability: Validations and common baselines enable consistent security across vendors and agencies.

- Operational guidance: Procedures for detection, response, and recovery to limit damage and speed remediation.

NIST turns security best practice into actionable, testable standards. Adopting its frameworks helps organizations manage risk systematically, prove due diligence, and raise overall cyber resilience.
