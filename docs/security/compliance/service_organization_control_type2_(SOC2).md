# Service Organization Control Type 2 (SOC2)
SOC 2 Type II is an independent attestation report (by a licensed CPA firm) that evaluates how well a service organization’s controls operate over time—typically across a 6–12 month review period—against the AICPA Trust Services Criteria (TSC). Unlike Type I, which is point-in-time, Type II proves ongoing effectiveness, using evidence like logs, tickets, configs, and change records.

## What is does
- Assesses and documents the design and operating effectiveness of controls tied to selected TSC categories: Security (required), and optionally Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy.

- Produces a customer-shareable report detailing the system, controls, tests performed, results, and any exceptions—supporting vendor risk reviews and due diligence.

- Requires continuous evidence (logs, tickets, configs, change records), promoting disciplined, repeatable operations.

## How it protects
- Security hardening: Enforces access control, MFA, vulnerability management, incident response, secure SDLC.

- Reliability & integrity: Validates uptime/DR practices and accurate, complete processing.

- Data safeguards: Confirms encryption, key management, data minimization, and privacy controls where in scope.

- Assurance & trust: Third-party verification reduces customer uncertainty and accelerates procurement.

SOC 2 Type II proves your controls don’t just exist—they work consistently over time, giving stakeholders high-confidence assurance about the security and reliability of your services.
