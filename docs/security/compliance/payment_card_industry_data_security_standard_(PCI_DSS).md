# Payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS)
PCI Security Standards are developed and maintained by the PCI Security Standards Council to protect payment data throughout the payment lifecycle. The different PCI Standards support different stakeholders and functions within the payments industry.

Some of the PCI Standards are intended for use by organizations involved in payments, such as merchants, service providers, and financial institutions, to use within their own environments. These standards support the implementation of secure practices, technologies, and processes within the organization.

Other PCI Standards are intended for developers, technology vendors, and solution providers wishing to demonstrate that their product or service was designed with security in mind and meets a defined set of security requirements. These standards support the validation and listing of products and services that meet the standard and validation program requirements.

All PCI Security Standards are developed in conjunction with a global network of payments industry stakeholders.

## What it does
- Sets prescriptive requirements across 12 control areas (secure networks/configs, encryption, vulnerability management, access control & MFA, logging/monitoring, testing, incident response).

- Provides assessment paths: SAQ (self-assessment) or ROC (QSA-audited) with an Attestation of Compliance (AOC).

## How it protects
- Data confidentiality: Strong encryption, key management, tokenization, data minimization.

- Access security: Least privilege, MFA, segmentation to isolate the CDE.

- System hygiene: Secure configuration, patching, anti-malware, secure development.

- Detection & response: Centralized logging, file integrity monitoring, regular scans/pen tests, defined IR plans.

PCI DSS is the baseline for preventing payment data breachesâ€”turning proven security practices into enforceable controls that safeguard cardholder data end-to-end.
