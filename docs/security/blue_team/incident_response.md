# Incident response
Incident response in cybersecurity refers to the structured process an organization follows to detect, manage, and recover from security incidents such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, or unauthorized access. The main objective is to handle threats quickly and efficiently to minimize damage, reduce recovery time, and prevent recurrence. When a potential incident is detected, the response team begins by identifying the source, scope, and severity of the threat. This early detection allows for a rapid and targeted reaction, helping to contain the incident before it spreads across systems or affects critical data.

Once containment is achieved, the next step is to eliminate the cause of the incident. This can involve removing malware, disabling compromised accounts, or patching vulnerabilities that were exploited. After the immediate threat is neutralized, the organization focuses on system recovery, restoring affected services and data from secure backups while verifying that all systems are clean and secure.

Following recovery, a post-incident analysis is conducted to understand how the breach occurred and to identify areas for improvement. This review often leads to updates in security policies, enhanced employee training, and stronger technical safeguards.

Overall, incident response is a vital part of cybersecurity strategy, ensuring that organizations can detect, contain, and recover from attacks effectively while continuously improving their resilience against future threats.
