# Digital forensics
Digital forensics is a branch of cybersecurity focused on the identification, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence after a security incident or cybercrime. Its main purpose is to determine what happened, how it happened, who was involved, and what data was affected. Digital forensics plays a crucial role in both incident response and legal investigations, helping organizations and law enforcement understand and prove the details of an attack.

The digital forensics process generally involves several key stages:

1.	Identification – Detecting potential sources of digital evidence, such as computers, mobile devices, servers, or cloud systems.
2.	Preservation – Securing and isolating data to prevent alteration or loss, ensuring that evidence remains admissible in court.
3.	Collection – Extracting relevant data using specialized forensic tools while maintaining a clear chain of custody.
4.	Analysis – Examining logs, files, and system activity to reconstruct the timeline of events and uncover how an attack was carried out.
5.	Reporting – Documenting findings in a clear and factual manner that can be used in legal proceedings or internal reviews.

Digital forensics specialists use tools such as EnCase, FTK, and Autopsy to analyze hard drives, recover deleted files, trace network activity, and detect malware behavior. They may also collaborate with law enforcement or internal security teams to provide evidence for legal or disciplinary action.

In summary, digital forensics combines technical expertise and investigative methods to uncover the truth behind cyber incidents. It ensures that digital evidence is handled properly, supports accountability, and strengthens an organization’s ability to respond effectively to cybercrime and security breaches.
