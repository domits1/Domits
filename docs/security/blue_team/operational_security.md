# Operational security
Operational security (OpSec) in cybersecurity refers to the process of protecting sensitive information and daily operations from being exposed, leaked, or exploited by malicious actors. It focuses on identifying critical information, analyzing potential threats, and implementing controls to reduce risks during regular business activities. The goal of operational security is to prevent attackers from gaining insights into an organization’s systems, strategies, or vulnerabilities that could be used against it.

Operational security is typically built around five key steps:

1.	Identification of critical information – Determining which data, assets, or processes must be protected (such as credentials, infrastructure details, or customer information).
2.	Threat analysis – Identifying who might target the organization and why, including cybercriminals, competitors, or insiders.
3.	Vulnerability analysis – Assessing how sensitive data could be exposed, for example through weak passwords, social engineering, or insecure communication channels.
4.	Risk assessment – Evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of each identified threat or weakness.
5.	Implementation of countermeasures – Applying security controls such as access management, encryption, employee awareness training, and data handling policies to mitigate identified risks.

Effective operational security also includes monitoring day-to-day activities, managing employee privileges carefully, and promoting awareness about information sharing — especially on social media or through third-party services.

In summary, operational security is about thinking like an attacker and protecting an organization’s most valuable information by reducing the clues and weaknesses that could be exploited. It combines human awareness, procedural discipline, and technical safeguards to maintain confidentiality and prevent unauthorized disclosure of critical information.
