# Threat hunters
Threat hunters are cybersecurity professionals who proactively search for hidden threats within an organization’s networks and systems before those threats can cause damage. Unlike traditional security measures that react to alerts from automated tools, threat hunters take an active and investigative approach — they look for indicators of compromise (IoCs), abnormal behavior, and advanced attacks that may bypass standard defenses.

The main goal of threat hunting is to detect sophisticated or stealthy cyberattacks early, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) or insider activities that go unnoticed by firewalls or antivirus software. Threat hunters analyze large volumes of system logs, network traffic, and endpoint activity to uncover patterns that suggest malicious intent or unauthorized behavior.

Typical activities of threat hunters include:

•	Forming hypotheses based on intelligence about current attack methods or unusual system behavior.
•	Investigating anomalies found in log data, network connections, or user activity.
•	Using advanced tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and threat intelligence platforms.
•	Collaborating with incident response teams to contain and eliminate discovered threats.
•	Documenting findings and improving defenses to strengthen overall security posture.

In essence, threat hunters act as cyber detectives, continuously searching for signs of compromise that automated systems might miss. Their proactive work helps organizations reduce detection time, prevent large-scale breaches, and improve resilience against evolving cyber threats.
