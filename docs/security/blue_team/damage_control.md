# Damage control
Damage control in cybersecurity refers to the actions taken after a cyberattack to limit its impact, restore affected systems, and prevent future incidents. When an organization experiences a security breach, such as ransomware, data theft, or a phishing-based intrusion, the immediate priority is to contain the threat before it spreads further. This often involves isolating compromised systems, disabling unauthorized accounts, and blocking malicious network traffic to protect other critical assets.

Once the situation is under control, the focus shifts to recovery. Security teams work to remove any malware, repair or restore corrupted data from secure backups, and patch vulnerabilities that were exploited during the attack. Continuous monitoring is essential throughout this process to ensure that no hidden threats remain in the network and that normal operations can safely resume.

After the technical recovery, organizations conduct a detailed review of the incident to identify weaknesses in their security posture. This post-incident analysis helps improve response procedures, strengthen access controls, and enhance staff awareness to reduce the risk of future breaches.

Overall, damage control plays a crucial role in minimizing losses, maintaining trust, and improving the long-term resilience of an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity defenses.
