# Black box testing
Black box testing is a cybersecurity and software testing method where the tester evaluates a system without any prior knowledge of its internal structure, code, or configuration. The goal is to assess how the system behaves from an external perspective, much like a real attacker or end user would.

In cybersecurity, black box testing is commonly used during penetration tests or security assessments to simulate an outsider’s attack. The tester only knows what is publicly accessible such as IP addresses, URLs, or login pages and must discover vulnerabilities through observation, probing, and reconnaissance. This approach helps identify weaknesses in areas like authentication, input validation, network exposure, and access controls.

The main advantage of black box testing is that it provides a realistic evaluation of external security defenses, showing how well the system can resist attacks from individuals with no insider information. However, it can also be time-consuming and less thorough than other methods (such as white box testing), since testers have limited visibility into internal components and may overlook hidden vulnerabilities.

In summary, black box testing focuses on what the system does, not how it does it, making it an effective technique for assessing real-world attack surfaces and validating the strength of an organization’s perimeter defenses.
