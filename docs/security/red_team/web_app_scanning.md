# Web app scanning
Web application scanning is the automated process of testing web applications for security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and misconfigurations. Scanners crawl websites, analyze pages and inputs, and send test requests to identify potential weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

The process typically includes discovery, active testing, and reporting of vulnerabilities with severity ratings and remediation guidance. Common tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Acunetix perform these scans as part of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).

Web app scanning is effective for finding common issues quickly and integrating into CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing. However, it may produce false positives and can miss complex logic flaws, so it should be complemented with manual testing and secure development practices.

In summary, web application scanning helps organizations detect and fix vulnerabilities early, strengthen their defenses, and maintain a secure online environment.
