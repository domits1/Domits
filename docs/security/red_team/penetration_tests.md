# Penetration tests
A penetration test (pen test) is a controlled, simulated cyberattack on systems, applications, or networks used to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. The process begins with clear planning and scoping, defining objectives, scope, rules of engagement, and written authorization to ensure safe and controlled testing.

Common types include external, internal, web and application, cloud, wireless, and social engineering tests such as phishing simulations.

A typical pen test involves several steps: reconnaissance (information gathering), vulnerability discovery, exploitation (safely validating weaknesses), and post-exploitation (assessing impact and persistence). This approach uncovers both technical and operational weaknesses, such as poor access controls or outdated patches.

After testing, the team delivers a comprehensive report detailing findings, risk ratings, and remediation recommendations, often with a management summary explaining the business impact. Some tests include a retest phase to verify that critical issues have been fixed.

Penetration testing helps validate security controls, improve incident response, and demonstrate compliance. However, it must be performed by qualified professionals under strict agreements to prevent disruption. Combined with continuous practices like patch management and monitoring, pen testing provides valuable insight into an organizationâ€™s overall security posture.
