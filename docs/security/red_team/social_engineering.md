# Social engineering
Social engineering is a cybersecurity threat technique that involves manipulating or deceiving people to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or confidential information. Instead of exploiting technical vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human psychology  using trust, fear, curiosity, or urgency to trick individuals into taking actions that compromise security.

Common social engineering methods include phishing (fraudulent emails that appear legitimate), vishing (voice phishing through phone calls), smishing (SMS-based scams), and pretexting (pretending to be someone trustworthy, such as a coworker or IT support). Attackers may also use baiting, where they lure victims with tempting offers or infected devices (like USB drives), and tailgating, where someone physically follows an employee into a restricted area.

The main goal of social engineering is to bypass technical defenses by targeting the weakest link in cybersecurity human behavior. Once successful, attackers may steal credentials, install malware, or gain deeper access to networks and systems.

Preventing social engineering attacks relies heavily on awareness and training. Employees should be taught to verify unexpected requests, avoid clicking suspicious links or attachments, and report unusual activity. Technical controls such as multi-factor authentication, email filtering, and access restrictions can further reduce the risk, but a security-aware culture remains the most effective defense.

In summary, social engineering exploits human trust rather than software flaws, making education and vigilance essential components of strong cybersecurity.
