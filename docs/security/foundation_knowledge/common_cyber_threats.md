# Common cyber threats
In today’s digital world, organizations and individuals face various cyber threats that can compromise data security, disrupt systems, and cause financial or reputational damage. The most common types include ransomware, phishing, insider threats, and social engineering.

## Randomware
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim’s files or entire system, making them inaccessible. The attacker then demands payment (a ransom) in exchange for restoring access. These attacks can cause severe financial losses and downtime for businesses. Prevention methods include regular data backups, updated antivirus software, and employee awareness training.

## Phishing
Phishing involves fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords or banking details, by posing as a trustworthy entity—often through fake emails or websites. Victims are tricked into clicking malicious links or sharing confidential data. The best protection against phishing is careful verification of messages and links, and the use of spam filters and multi-factor authentication.

## Insider threats
Insider threats come from individuals within an organization, such as employees or contractors, who misuse their access to harm the company. This can include stealing data, leaking confidential information, or unintentionally causing security breaches. Managing insider threats involves monitoring system access, maintaining strict access controls, and promoting a culture of security awareness.

## Social engineering
Social engineering refers to manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. This can include phone scams, impersonation, or psychological manipulation. Attackers often exploit human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. Awareness training and strict verification procedures are key to defending against these attacks.
