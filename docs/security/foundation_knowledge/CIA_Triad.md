# CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in information security that describes three essential principles for protecting data and systems: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three elements form the foundation for developing and maintaining secure information systems.

## Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessible to individuals who are authorized to view it. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data. Common methods to maintain confidentiality include encryption, strong access control mechanisms, authentication, and proper data classification.

## Integrity
Integrity refers to the accuracy and completeness of information. It ensures that data remains unchanged from its original form, except when modified through authorized actions. Techniques such as hashing, digital signatures, and checksums are commonly used to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Availability
Availability ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. It focuses on maintaining the continuous operation of systems and preventing downtime. Measures such as regular backups, redundancy, and robust network infrastructure help maintain high availability.
Together, these three principlesâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability form the core framework for managing and protecting information within any organization.
