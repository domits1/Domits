# Security Hub compliance
Using AWS Security Hub for compliance is centered around continuous monitoring, assessment, and reporting of AWS resources against predefined compliance standards. Here’s an in-depth look at how AWS Security Hub helps organizations manage compliance effectively and how you can utilize it to ensure our AWS environment meets regulatory and security best practice requirements.

## Enabled compliance standards for continuous monitoring
Prebuilt Compliance Frameworks: AWS Security Hub offers a variety of prebuilt compliance frameworks such as CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, PCI DSS, AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, and more. These standards have controls that assess AWS resources, configurations, and policies to ensure they align with specific compliance requirements.

Automatic Scanning and Control Checks: After enabling a compliance standard in Security Hub, it continuously scans your AWS environment for any deviations from the required controls. Each control is mapped to specific AWS resources and evaluates if the configuration adheres to the standard. This scanning is automatic and frequent, ensuring compliance status is always current.

## Reviewing compliance findings
Consolidated Compliance Dashboard: Security Hub’s compliance dashboard gives an aggregated view of findings for each compliance standard enabled. It shows which controls are passing, which are failing, and where potential compliance risks exist. This centralized view enables compliance teams to quickly assess overall compliance posture and pinpoint areas of concern.

Drill-Down on Specific Findings: For each failing control, Security Hub provides detailed findings that describe the specific compliance issue, the affected resources, and recommendations for remediation. This level of detail is crucial for understanding exactly what needs to be fixed and why, which is particularly important when auditing resources or preparing for compliance audits.

## Customizing and prioritizing compliance controls
Selective Enabling of Controls: Not all controls may be relevant to every organization, depending on industry, risk tolerance, and regulatory requirements. Security Hub allows us to enable or disable specific controls within a standard to customize the compliance assessment based on what is most relevant for us.

Severity-Based Prioritization: Compliance findings are categorized by severity level, which helps compliance teams prioritize high-risk findings over less critical issues. For example, a critical finding, such as unrestricted access to sensitive resources, can be addressed immediately, while low-risk findings might be managed as part of routine maintenance.

## Automated remediation and workflow integration
Automated Remediation with AWS Lambda: To support compliance efforts, AWS Security Hub integrates with AWS Lambda to automate responses for certain compliance issues. For example, if a finding reveals non-compliant public access on an S3 bucket, a Lambda function can be triggered to remove that access, thereby remediating the compliance issue automatically.

Integration with AWS Systems Manager and Step Functions: Security Hub findings can be routed to AWS Systems Manager for tracking and resolution or orchestrated through AWS Step Functions to create workflows for more complex compliance management tasks. This allows for structured and repeatable remediation processes.

Ticketing Integration for Compliance Workflow: Security Hub can integrate with ticketing and workflow tools like Jira and ServiceNow, which helps compliance teams track findings as part of their regular workflow. Each finding can generate a ticket, making it easier for teams to assign, track, and verify remediation work in a way that aligns with audit and compliance processes.

## Compliance reporting and audits preperation
Automated Compliance Reports: Security Hub generates reports on the status of compliance with various standards, which can be used to demonstrate compliance to internal and external auditors. These reports are downloadable and include detailed findings, summaries of compliant vs. non-compliant resources, and status updates for each control.

Evidence Collection and Retention: Each finding in Security Hub provides detailed records that can be used as evidence of compliance or non-compliance during an audit. This documentation is essential for organizations that need to prove compliance or demonstrate that issues were identified and remediated.

In Summary: Using AWS Security Hub for compliance offers a comprehensive, automated approach to continuously monitor and assess your AWS environment against industry standards. By adding automated remediation, integration with workflow tools, and centralized reporting, compliance teams can streamline compliance efforts, quickly address non-compliant configurations, and maintain a strong compliance posture across complex cloud environments.

## GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is designed to protect the personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU). It requires businesses and website owners to follow strict guidelines on how they collect, store, process, and use personal data. To achieve compliance, you need a structured approach that addresses transparency, security, and accountability.

## Data flows
Identify all the personal data your website collects, such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, and cookie information. Map how this data is collected, where it is stored, how it is processed, and with whom it is shared. Knowing your data flows is essential because GDPR mandates that you be accountable for all personal data you process.

## Privacy policy
A Privacy Policy is one of the cornerstones of GDPR compliance. This document should explain:

- What data you collect (e.g., names, contact information, cookies).
- Why you collect it (e.g., to process orders, improve user experience).
- How you process and store it.
- Who you share it with (e.g., payment processors, analytics providers).
- How users can exercise their rights under GDPR.

Make the Privacy Policy easy to understand by avoiding legal jargon and placing it prominently on your website, such as in the footer or during the account creation process.

## Consent for data collection
For non-essential data collection, such as analytics, advertising, or cookies, you must secure explicit consent from users. Implement a cookie consent banner that:

- Appears before any cookies are set.
- Allows users to choose which cookies they accept.
- Clearly distinguishes between essential and non-essential cookies.
- Provides an option for users to withdraw or update their consent at any time.

Ensure the consent mechanism is user-friendly and avoids pre-ticked boxes, as GDPR requires opt-in consent.

## Enable users to exercice their rights
GDPR grants users several rights over their data, including:

- Right to Access: Users can request a copy of their personal data.
- Right to Rectify: Users can ask for incorrect data to be corrected.
- Right to Erase (Right to be Forgotten): Users can request their data to be deleted.
- Right to Data Portability: Users can request their data in a machine-readable format.

To comply, set up a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) process. Provide a simple way for users to contact you, such as a dedicated email address or online form, and respond promptly (within 30 days) to their requests.

## Secure personal data
Protecting user data is a fundamental aspect of GDPR. Implement strong data security measures, such as:

- Encrypting sensitive data during storage and transmission.
- Regularly updating your website and software to patch vulnerabilities.
- Restricting access to personal data to authorized personnel only.
- Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

If you work with third-party vendors (e.g., cloud providers, email marketing platforms), ensure they also comply with GDPR. Sign Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with these vendors to outline their responsibilities.

## Data retention
GDPR requires you to keep personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose. Develop a data retention policy that specifies how long you retain different types of data. Automate the deletion of outdated data to minimize risks and ensure compliance.

## Monitor and audit compliance
GDPR compliance is an ongoing process. Conduct regular audits of your data processing activities to ensure that your practices align with GDPR requirements. Update your Privacy Policy, cookie banner, and consent mechanisms as your business evolves or regulations change.

If your website targets EU users, you may need to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) or designate a team member to oversee data protection practices.

## Prepare for data breaches
Data breaches can happen, even with strong security measures. Under GDPR, you must notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovering a breach if it poses a risk to users’ rights and freedoms. Notify affected users as well, providing clear instructions on how they can protect themselves.

To prepare:

- Create a Data Breach Response Plan that outlines how to detect, contain, and report breaches.
- Train your team to recognize and respond to potential security incidents.

## ISO 27001
ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It provides a framework to protect sensitive data systematically and effectively, addressing people, processes, and technology. Achieving ISO 27001 certification demonstrates your organization’s commitment to managing information security risks and complying with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

## ISO 27001 Framework
ISO 27001 revolves around establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). This system consists of policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate risks and safeguard information. The key focus areas include:

- Confidentiality: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized individuals.
- Integrity: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
- Availability: Ensuring authorized users can access data when needed.

The standard also emphasizes a risk-based approach, requiring organizations to identify and address information security risks.

## The scope of ISMS
Identify which parts of your organization will be covered under the ISMS. This can include:

- Business functions: Specific departments or processes.
- Locations: Physical sites where information is handled.
- Assets: Systems, databases, or applications involved in data storage and processing.

Clearly defining the scope ensures that your security measures are focused on critical areas without unnecessary overhead.

## Risk assessment
A risk assessment is central to ISO 27001 compliance. Follow these steps:

- Identify risks: Determine potential threats and vulnerabilities to your information assets (e.g., cyberattacks, insider threats, physical theft).
- Assess likelihood and impact: Evaluate how likely each risk is to occur and the potential impact.
- Prioritize risks: Focus on high-priority risks that pose significant threats.

Use the results of the risk assessment to develop a Risk Treatment Plan, detailing how you will mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept each risk.

## Security Controls -> based on risk assessment
Annex A of ISO 27001 provides a list of 114 controls that address various aspects of information security, such as:

- Access control: Limiting access to authorized users only.
- Cryptography: Protecting sensitive data with encryption.
- Physical security: Securing office spaces, servers, and hardware.
- Incident management: Developing a plan to respond to security incidents.
- Supplier relationships: Ensuring third-party vendors follow security practices.

Select and implement controls based on your risk assessment, tailoring them to your organization’s specific needs.

## Training and awareness
People are often the weakest link in information security. Conduct regular training and awareness programs to educate employees on:

- Recognizing phishing and other cyber threats.
- Following secure password practices.
- Handling sensitive data responsibly.
- Reporting potential security incidents.

Awareness training helps create a security-conscious culture across your organization.

## Monitor, measure and audit
ISO 27001 requires ongoing monitoring and measurement to ensure the ISMS is effective. Implement processes to:

- Regularly review and update security controls.
- Monitor system logs, access controls, and incident reports.
- Conduct internal audits to identify gaps and ensure compliance with the standard.

Schedule an external audit by a certification body to achieve official ISO 27001 certification.

## Continual improvement
ISO 27001 emphasizes continuous improvement. Use feedback from audits, risk assessments, and incidents to refine your ISMS. Establish a cycle of regular reviews to adapt to changes in technology, regulations, or your business environment.

## PCI DSS Framework
PCI DSS has 12 core requirements that organizations must meet to achieve compliance. These requirements are grouped into six goals, covering all aspects of payment card data security:

- Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems
Install and maintain a firewall configuration: Protect cardholder data by setting up and maintaining firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.
Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters: Ensure all devices and software use secure, unique configurations.
- Protect Cardholder Data
Protect stored cardholder data: Encrypt or tokenize sensitive data and minimize storage of payment card information.
Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks: Use strong encryption (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) to secure data in transit.
- Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program
Protect all systems against malware and regularly update antivirus software or programs: Implement antivirus software and keep it updated.
Develop and maintain secure systems and applications: Regularly patch and update systems to address known vulnerabilities.
- Implement Strong Access Control Measures
Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis: Only grant access to individuals who require it for their job roles. 8 Identify and authenticate access to system components: Use strong authentication measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Restrict physical access to cardholder data: Secure areas where sensitive data is stored or processed to prevent unauthorized physical access.
- Regularly Monitor and Test Networks
Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data: Implement logging and monitoring to ensure all access is recorded and reviewed.
Regularly test security systems and processes: Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify weaknesses.
- Maintain an Information Security Policy
Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel: Develop, document, and enforce an information security policy that covers all aspects of your organization.

## PCI DSS Compliance level
PCI DSS compliance levels depend on your annual transaction volume:

- Level 1: Over 6 million transactions annually.
- Level 2: 1–6 million transactions annually.
- Level 3: 20,000–1 million transactions annually.
- Level 4: Fewer than 20,000 transactions annually.

Each level has different compliance validation requirements, such as Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) or on-site audits conducted by Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs). Determine your level to understand the scope of your compliance efforts.

## Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)
Define the scope of your Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)—the systems and processes that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. This includes:

- Payment gateways.
- Web servers that handle transactions.
- Databases storing card information.

To minimize risks, implement network segmentation to isolate the CDE from other parts of your network. This reduces the scope of PCI DSS compliance and simplifies your efforts.

## Security controls
To comply with PCI DSS, implement the following key controls:

- Encrypt Cardholder Data: Use strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) to secure card data both at rest and in transit.
- Mask PANs (Primary Account Numbers): Ensure that full card numbers are visible only to authorized personnel.
- Install Firewalls: Configure firewalls to protect sensitive systems and prevent unauthorized access.
- Update and Patch Systems: Regularly update software and firmware to address vulnerabilities.
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Require MFA for remote access to the CDE.

Additionally, ensure that payment card data is not stored unnecessarily. If storing data is unavoidable, implement tokenization to replace sensitive information with non-sensitive tokens.

## Monitoring and testing
PCI DSS emphasizes ongoing monitoring and testing to ensure security:

- Install Logging and Monitoring Tools: Continuously monitor access to cardholder data and network activity.
- Conduct Regular Vulnerability Scans: Perform quarterly scans and address identified issues promptly.
- Perform Penetration Testing: Simulate attacks on your systems to identify and fix weaknesses.
-  Maintain Audit Logs: Retain detailed logs of all access to cardholder data for at least a year.

These practices help detect potential threats and ensure a robust defense against breaches.

## Train your team
Educate employees on the importance of protecting payment data. Training should include:

- Recognizing phishing attempts and social engineering attacks.
- Handling cardholder data securely.
- Following secure payment processes.

Training promotes a culture of security awareness, reducing human errors that could lead to data breaches.

## Maintain compliance
PCI DSS compliance is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update security measures to adapt to evolving threats. Incorporate continuous monitoring and incident response planning to stay proactive in protecting cardholder data. Additionally, renew your compliance validation annually to maintain your certified status.
