**AWS Tools For Software Testing**

* [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/): A cloud-based mobile app testing service that allows developers to test their apps on real devices in the AWS Cloud. This service supports both Android and iOS devices and can be used to automate testing using frameworks such as Appium and Espresso.
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): A serverless compute service that allows developers to run code in response to events or triggers. This service can be used to automate the execution of test cases and to perform continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of test scripts.
* [AWS Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/): Security testing tool. Automatically discovers workloads, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions, and scans them for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.
* [AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS)](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/): Infrastructure testing tool. A fully managed service for running fault injection experiments to improve an application’s performance, observability, and resilience. FIS simplifies the process of setting up and running controlled fault injection experiments across a range of AWS services, so teams can build confidence in their application behavior.
* [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/): A fully managed build service that can be used to compile, test, and package code. This service can be used to create a CI/CD pipeline for testing code changes automatically.
* [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/): A fully managed continuous delivery service that can be used to automate the release process for applications. This service can be used to automatically build, test, and deploy code changes to production.
* [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/): A fully managed source control service that can be used to store and manage code repositories securely. This service can be used to store test scripts and to track changes to them over time.
* [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/): A monitoring service that can be used to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. This service can be used to monitor the performance of test cases and to trigger alerts when issues arise.
