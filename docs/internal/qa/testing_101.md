Quality assurance (QA) testing services include testing such as automated and manual testing, security testing services, mobile app testing, web application testing, QA consulting, and continuous testing during the development process. Software QA services are not about checking the performance of a single function or test automation; it is about the whole test environment, the company, and the product.

[Visual roadmap onboarding QA](https://roadmap.sh/qa).

Here are main areas with questions to ask when taking over an application with testing. 

1. **Application Overview and Importance**: 
   - What are the primary functions of your application?
   - How crucial is it for the business operations and revenue generation?
   - Does it integrate closely with other internal or external services and applications?

2. **Development and Maintenance**:
   - Is the application actively under development? If so, can you describe the team's size, experience, and duration of involvement with this project?
   - Do you allocate a budget specifically for its maintenance?
  
3. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - How updated is your application, and do you possess an automated update mechanism?
   - Is there a comprehensive automated test suite in place that covers essential business functions? 
   - Are there parts of the application that cause concern, and do you have the means to address these?
   - Can you describe your deployment process, including details on automation, tools, frequency, and handling of unsuccessful deployments?

**Testing and Deployment**:
   - Analysis of requirements
   - Planning tests
   - Test case development or checklists
   - Test execution or completing checklists
   - Verification.
   - Retesting fixed bugs and performing regression testing.
   - Documentation and reporting.
