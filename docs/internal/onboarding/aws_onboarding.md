# AWS Onboarding Guide (Invite-Based Access)

This guide explains how to access an existing AWS account after receiving an invite link.

---

## Step 1 — Open the AWS Invite Link
You will receive a link to AWS.

1. Click the **AWS invite link**
2. You will be taken to the AWS sign-in page

---

## Step 2 — Sign In for the First Time
Enter the credentials **provided** to you:

- **Username**
- **Temporary password**

Click **Sign in**.

---

## Step 3 — Change Your Password
After your first login, AWS will require you to change your password.

1. Enter the **temporary password**
2. Create a **new password**
3. Confirm the new password
4. Click **Submit**

---

## Step 4 — Sign In Again
After changing your password:

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Enter your **username** and **new password**
3. Sign in to the AWS Management Console

---

## Step 5 — Open IAM (Identity and Access Management)

1. In the AWS console search bar, type **IAM**
2. Click **IAM**
3. Select **Users**
4. Click your **username**

---

## Step 6 — Request Permissions
By default, your user may not have access to AWS resources.

Permissions must be **provided** by adding:
- The correct **IAM group**, or
- The required **IAM policies**

Until permissions are added, you may see access errors. This is expected.

---

## Step 7 — Log Out and Log Back In
After permissions are provided:

1. Log out of AWS
2. Log back in

Your permissions will now be active.
