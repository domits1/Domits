## Xcode delegate file not found error


### The problem
There could be a problem that occurs out of nowhere in Xcode that says: delegate file not found. and as long as this error occurs your not able to build de simulator or publish the app file into testflight.

### How do you solve the problem?

- Reïnstall Xcode and the pods
- Eventually deinstalled gem and ruby and redownloaded all of it and also give full disc premission in the terminal
- After the full disc premission the pod install might perform the actuall installation.
- After everything was done you might get a flipper error: but the flipper error was easily solved by running `export NO_FLIPPER=1` -
  `cd ios` - `pod install`
- After following these steps, go to Xcode, click on Product and then Clean Build Folder.
- Then click on Product again and select Build, and that should solve the issue.

### The problem
After changing some aws-amplify packages in package.json, this error could pop up when trying to start up Xcdoe.

### How do you solve the problem?
First of all revert all the changes back though your code editor. After you have reverted the changed back (package.json) you go to the `ios` folder and run `pod install --repo-update` in the terminal.

After you run the line in the terminal most there might be chance that this error pops up (after you try to start Xcode again):

but this error basicaly means that you have to clear the build and rebuild in xcode.

as a last step it might complain about flipper again but for this issue you just run (cd .. out of ios folder) `export NO_FLIPPER=1` then you `cd ios` and finally run `pod install`
